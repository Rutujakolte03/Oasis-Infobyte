          <h3>Early Life</h3>
          <p>
            Savitribai Phule was born on 3 January 1831 at the village of Naigaon in Satara District, Maharashtra. 
            Her birthplace is about fifteen km (9.3 mi) from Shirval and about 50 km (31 mi) from Pune.
            Savitribai Phule was the youngest daughter of Lakshmi and Khandoji Nevase Patil, both of whom belonged to the Mali Community.
             She had three siblings. Savitribai married her husband Jyotirao Phule at the age of 9 or 10 (he was 13). 
             Though they had no children of their own. It is said that they adopted Yashawantrao, a son born to a Brahmin widow.
              However, there is no original evidence available yet to support this.
             It is said that Yashwant was unable to get married because he was born to a widow, and community beliefs disallowed marriage of "such people".
             Hence Savitribai arranged his marriage to her organization worker Dynoba Sasane's daughter in February of 1889.

          <h3>Academic Life</h3>
          <p>
            Savitribai was illiterate at the time of her marriage. Jyotirao educated Savitribai and Sagunabai Shirsagar, 
            his cousin sister at their home along with working at their farm.
             Once she completed her primary education with Jyotirao, her further education was the responsibility of his friends,
              Sakharam Yeshwant Paranjpe and Keshav Shivram Bhavalkar.
              [additional citation(s) needed]She also enrolled herself in two teacher's training programs; the first was at institution run by an American missionary, 
              Cynthia Farrar, in Ahmednagar, and the second course was at a Normal School in Poona (Now Pune).
             Given her training, Savitribai may have been the first Indian woman teacher and headmistress
